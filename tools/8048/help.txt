
  This is the main File menu.  The following commands
  are available:
   Load - load a file from disk into the text buffer.
   Save - save the contents of the text buffer to a file
     under the current file name.
   Save as - save the text buffer under a new name.
   XMem file - loads a hex file into an internal memory
     buffer.
   Print - print the text in the buffer.  The printer
     port selected in options is used for printing.
   Burn - executes a DOS command: BURN filename.
   Info - displays info on the editors current status.
   DOS shell - exit to a DOS shell.
   Quit - Quit the program.


  A list of files matching the specified (or default)
  filespec have been displayed.  Select the desired
  file by highlighting it and pressing the ENTER key.


  Select which type of monitor is connected to this
  computer (COLOR or MONOCHROME).


  Select which parallel port your printer is connected
  to (LPT1, LPT2 or LPT3).  If you to not have a printer
  connected to your system the set the printer port to
  OFF.


  This menu allows you to specify which files are to be
  generated during the assembly process.  Setting an
  entry to YES will cause that file to be generated.
  Each of the file types are:
    Generate list file - listing file containing line
       number, hex program codes and source lines.
    Generate symbol file - file containing a list of
       symbols used in a source file and their
       corresponding values.
    Generate instruction count - list of each instruction
       used and how many times it was used in the source
       file.
    Generate hex file - this file contains the assembled
       code which is generated from the source file.
       This file is in Intel hex format.

  This is the main Options menu, this menu allows you
  to specify various system level settings.  These
  settings include:

    Printer port - defines which printer port to use
      when printing source code.

    Monitor - defines the type of monitor connected to
      your computer.  Some things will not show up
      on a monochrome monitor if this is set to Color.

    File generation - defines which files are to be
      created during assembly.  Each file being generated
      creates more overhead and slows down the assembly
      process.

    Tab width - defines where tab stops are to be placed.
      Pressing the TAB key inserts spaces and not the tab
      character.

    Set output radix - defines the default radix to be
      used by the simulator when displaying numbers.

    Home directory - defines the directory where the
      8048.EXE program resides.  This allows the program
      to locate the help files if you are not in its
      home directory.

    Chip type - specifies which target CPU is to be used.
      This allows the assembler to inform you if your
      code becomes larger than the target CPU.  It also
      specifies to the programmer which chip is being
      programmed.

    Programmer port - specifies which printer port the
      programmer is attached to (LPT1, LPT2 or LPT3).

    Save configuration - allows you to save the current
      settings which you have defined.  This  config-
      uration file is saved in the current directory,
      this allows you to have different configurations
      for each project. This is the 8048 Assembler/Simulator main menu.  The
 available commands are:
   File: Load, Save, Save as, XMem file, Print,
     DOS shell, Burn, Info and quit.
   Edit: allows you to edit a previously loaded text file
     or create a new one.
   Assemble: assembles the text currently in the editors
     text buffer.
   Simulator: allows you to step through your program
    viewing the registers, flags, ports and memory.
   Program; allows you to program, blank check, verify
     and read the contents of an 8748/49 in the
     programmer.
   Options: allows you to specify assembly file
    generation, monitor type, printer port and simulator
    radix.

  This is the simulation screen, displayed on this screen
  is your source code, flags, registers, RAM memory and
  ports.


  You can move from window to window by pressing the 
  <TAB> and <SHIFT><TAB> keys.  You can scroll through
  each window using the up arrow, down arrow, page up,
  page down, home and end keys.


  Once in the flag, register, memory or port window
  each entry can be modified by highlighting it and
  pressing the ENTER key.  Then enter the new value.



  You can also modify flags, registers, memory and ports
  from any window by using the follwoing commands:

      FLAG flag state       i.e. FLAG CY 1
      REG register value    i.e. REG R0 1001b
      RAM address value     i.e. RAM 32 89h
      PORT port value       i.e. PORT P2 24
      RESET                 resets the cpu

  to issue any of these commands simply start typing the
  command.  A window will pop up allowing you to enter
  the rest of the command.





  The function keys perform the following functions:

    F1 displays this help message.
    F4 executes to the currently highlighted source line.
    F7 executes the next instruction stepping into CALLs.
    F8 executes the next instruction stepping over CALLs.
    F10 returns you to the main menu.


  When in the Register, Memory or Port windows you have
  the addition command:

    F9 Select radix for highlighted Register/Mem/Port.



  The flags displayed in the flag window are defined
  as follows:
    CY   - Carry flag.
    AC   - Auxiliary Carry flag.
    BS   - Working register Bank switch Select.
    F0   - User controlled Flag 0 bit.

  Enter the name of the file to save the contents of the
  text buffer to.  This can be any valid DOS file name.


  This window displays the current status of the
  editor.  The name of the currently loaded file,
  its size in bytes.  The size of the text buffer
  and the number of bytes left in the buffer.



  This window displays the result of the assembly
  process.  The number of errors, lines assembled
  and ending address is displayed.

  Press any key to return to the main menu.



  Select which parallel port your programmer is
  connected to (LPT1, LPT2 or LPT3).  If you to not
  have a programmer then set (or leave) the programmer
  port to OFF.


  Enter the number of spaces between tab stops used
  by the editor.


  Select the default output radix used to display
  values in the Simulator.


  Enter the drive and directory containing the 8048
  program files.  This will allow you to access the
  help files from a directory other than the one
  containing the 8048 program files.



  Select the target CPU is to be used in this design.
  This allows the assembler to inform you if your
  code becomes larger than the target CPU.  It also
  specifies to the programmer which chip is being
  programmed.


  When an 8748/49 is in the programmers ZIF socket,
  pin 11 of the ZIF socket (ALE) should toggle between
  high and low.  The programmer has reported that the
  ALE line is not toggling indicating that the chip
  to be programmed is improperly socketed.

  If the 8748/49 is in the socket properly then it
  may be damaged and need to be replaced.


  Insert the 8748/49 into the programmers ZIF socket.
  Do not insert the 8748/49 until instructed to do so.
  Inserting the 8748/47 into the program when it is
  not ready may damage the 8748/49.
