Reported bugs fixed in version 1.18

- Did not evaluate 0-X to 2's compliment notation.  0-X is now evaluated to
  100H-X for byte operands, and 10000H-X for word operands.  For example the
  instruction: MOV A,#0-5 will now evaluate to MOV A,#251

- Expressions such as the following: CTIME-2 evaluated improperly.  The original
  equation evaluation trapped the E-2 in CTIME-2, as an exponent.  This has been
  fixed (exponents can no longer be specified, not that they were needed in the
  first place).

- Simulation of the ORL P2,#Value instruction did not execute properly.  It would
  be simulated as follows: P2 = P1 or Value.  One of the pit falls of the editors
  cut and paste.  This has been fixed.

- Version 1.18 no longer requires you to specify a home directory to locate the
  help files.  It now looks at the command line passed by DOS to locate the
  directory where the 8048.EXE program resides.  This is not actually a bug
  but makes it a little more convienent when working with files in directories
  other than the one containing the 8048.EXE program.

- Availability of the 8748 chip programmer is now mentioned in the online manual
  (sorry but it isn't available at this time).  Press <CTRL><F1> to get the main
  index, go to Programmer, and read the opening paragraph.
